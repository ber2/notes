## Agenda
Let's agree on a path forward for how to integrate with TTD.

## Notes
- The choice to avoid two segments defined in both DSPs will be up to the trader. We will enable segments in both DSPs.

#### Data outputs
- User ids mapper: M
  Necessita afegir el partner al codi.
- Custom audience segments. 

## Actions

The conclusion is that we should have a plan in place and perhaps implement first steps due to the risk in changes in our agreement with [[Xandr]] (adding [[The Trade Desk|TTD]] as a means of not putting all the eggs in one basket).
