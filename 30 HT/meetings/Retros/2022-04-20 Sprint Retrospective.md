# Sprint Retro 2022-04-20

## OMG Why
- Gorka: Motomami Tour. This is the news of the week. Not good.
- Alejandro: Integration tests and CI. Tests in local and in circleCI differ due to hardware constraints.
  Ferran: integration tests in circle CI take very long for platform-ui.
  There is room for improvement here.
  

## Sad
- Ferran: not much to do before the four day weekend. Bored because Gorka and Jordi were away on holidays.
- Gorka: DSP-sync strikes again. This has been the problem of the week. We are working on it
- Julio: End to end test & Airflow. How could we automatize and make airflow validations easier.
- Patri: I am a bit lazy after Easter. Me too.
## Happy
- Ferran: Four day weekend
- Bertu: Four day week
- Bertu: Sparking joy in both Redshifts.
- Julio: Tech tales momentum.
- Patricia: Time to learn more Scala
- Ferran: Infra. Enjoying working on the new VPC stuff
- Ferran: Python 3.10. APIs are now migrated to Python 3.10 and life is sweet.

## Notes & Actions
- Migration of DSP into AWS S3 as in [here](https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-api/page/passive-segment-upload-using-aws-s3.html).
