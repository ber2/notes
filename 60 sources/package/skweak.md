A python package for [[Weak supervision]] for [[NLP]]

> Labelled data remains a scarce resource in many practical NLP scenarios. This is especially the case when working with resource-poor languages (or text domains), or when using task-specific labels without pre-existing datasets. The only available option is often to collect and annotate texts by hand, which is expensive and time-consuming.
>
> `skweak` (pronounced `/skwi:k/`) is a Python-based software toolkit that provides a concrete solution to this problem using weak supervision. `skweak` is built around a very simple idea: Instead of annotating texts by hand, we define a set of _labelling functions_ to automatically label our documents, and then _aggregate_ their results to obtain a labelled version of our corpus.
