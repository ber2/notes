# Humour

What makes you grumpy?
How will I know when you’re grumpy?
How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

# Feedback

How do you like feedback - the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)
How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens
How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

# Expectations

What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?
What do you need from your manager?
From your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)
From your peers? (outside the team)
