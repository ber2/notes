Meeting with: [[Patricia Lamadrid]]

# Humour

### What makes you grumpy?

Blocks with work, but more importantly blockage due to communication problems. This is partly due to a lack of competence in English, but also has a component of nerves when speaking in public.

- Already learning English in Udemy.

### How will I know when you’re grumpy?

More than grumpy, Patricia gets nervous. When this happens, she feels blocked and has trouble to express her emotions, and she needs some time to process and understand how she's feeling.

### How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

Leave her some room to process when this happens; and talk to her and communicate once she feels better.


# Feedback

Negative -> Private, chat, video call.
Positive -> Like to praise in public at team level; also approves of appraising the whole team towards the outside.


# Expectations

### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

### What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

Professionally: adapt to HT rhythm, finish "landing" into here.
Learn Scala.

English: dejó Preply y comunicación en inglés con language exchange.

Cursos: Udemy.

### What do you need from your manager?

1-1s are valuable

### From your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)
### From your peers? (outside the team)

# Way to treat yourself

Spending time in good company. Family, friends.
