Meeting with: [[Miriam Aumatell]]

# Humour

### What makes you grumpy?

Working with someone in a bad mood.
Tries to be in a good mood in order to ease social interactions.

Feeling that she brings no value into the picture.

Likes the organization we have (ceremonies, etc)

### How will I know when you’re grumpy?

She has a hard time telling when she's grumpy.
1-1s are a good place to do this.

### How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

Ho porta per dins. Potser estarà més callada del normal.


# Feedback

- Mitjà en persona
- 1:1, or as it happens
- Recognition: as the team.


# Expectations

### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

### What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

### What do you need from your manager?

### From your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)
### From your peers? (outside the team)

# Way to treat yourself

Menjar un bombó
Un sopar
Cuidar-se a si mateixa
Una tarda lliure de relax
