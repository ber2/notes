- Easter (all)
  Yay
- Data sprint (Bertu + Alicia)
  Stating the obvious
- Design a new project (Julio)
  Happy to have done the spike to migrate category segments into Databricks.
- Pair programming refactor (Alicia)
  Big refactor and we did in pair programming. Cool.
- Working with docker airflow (Patricia)
- Testing with Python <3 (Patricia)
  Both this task and the previous one were enjoyable for Patricia
- Udemy (Ferran)
  Enjoyable.
- Python 3.10 (Ferran)
  Some interface projects are already running Python 3.10
