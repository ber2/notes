# Sprint Retro 2022-03-10

## OMG Why
## Sad

- __Stressful Sprint__. Ferran (+ Julio, Alicia, Alejandro)
Ferran: lots of harder tasks, felt much harder than usual.
Alejandro: problems understanding AC of stories.

- __Covid and tiredness__. Miriam
General ranting about being under the weather due to covid and its impact on the sprint.

- __Timeline for new VPCs__. Gorka
There will be no time to migrate all infrastructure from EC2 into VPCs.

- __Tired__. Julio
Been feeling very tired physically and mentally.
Feeling tired continuously.

- __Same retro format__. Julio
An idea: in my previous company we used to change the retro format each time.
For instance: a different format can be about _things that helped the team to work faster_ vs _things that blocked the team_.
Ferran suggests Julio to propose a new format for the next retro.

## Happy

- __Mediagrid raw lambda__. Ferran
Fun to play with AWS Lambdas.
But task was poorly defined.
Several key pieces about which only found out when trying to deploy the lambda.
Remark about unnecessary comments in the PR.
Happily resolved by discussion with Jordi.

- __Mocking and patching like a pro & Pair pro with Gorka__. Alicia
Very happy to have learned about this by talks and pair pro with Gorka.

- __Testing training sessions__. Miriam
Very interesting pair of talks (Alberto & Gorka) on testing.

- __Finished stressful sprint__. Alejandro
Happy that sprint was finished successfully, even with Jordi absent due to covid.

- __My first task in Data Board done and deployed__. Miriam

- __Finished stuff (performant domains, lookalikes scoring, rtss)__. Alberto
Good too see some long running projects get to milestones.

- __Good (data) sprint__. Alberto
Good effort, most of it was delivered on time, good amount of team work. Team work and pair programming still up at a high amount consistenly last two sprints: let's make this the new "normal".
