## Notes from Miriam's experiments
In [RED-186](https://hybridtheory.atlassian.net/browse/RED-186).

Two analysis were carried out on the real case of Crocs.
- One with real revenue, with poor results
- Another one with only our own campaigns data, with very good but trivial results

A year of data was taken into account and aggregated per day.
