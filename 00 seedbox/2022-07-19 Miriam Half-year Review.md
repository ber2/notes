## Documents
In a google drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lr1Xu955U7uQSgtFSVkNMC4cIgEahfxl).


## General overview
Hi ha tres temes en particular que ressalten:
- Més ganes de fer enginyeria de dades i participar
- Problemes per afrontar tasques de negoci "R&D" més pures
- Voluntat d'aprendre més, en particular Scala i Deep Learning
- Estrés i problemes per organitzar-se a l'hora de treballar des de casa
 
## Part one: Looking back

### Key achievements:
- Adding a full new feature in Lookalikes V2 and building a tool to monitor input data
Lookalikes V2: yes
Tool to monitor data: S3 files monitoring in data-explorations

- Analysis of new tools of packages done from R&D
Robyn, Geolift...
Firmographic, Persona via Social Media

- Learning Scala and doing small tasks using it
Yes

Did not go so well:
- Finish Scala course
On diries que es troba actualment la teva zona de comfort respecte de Scala?

- Face experimental tasks with more confidence and more planning
This comes with experience. It helps to break down in small tasks and to try to frame them as an experiment when possible.
- More concentration in general; more discipline

Key Strengths:
- Good attitude to learn
- Work well with other people, like to collaborate
- Like to go deep in the understanding of projects and tasks

Key areas for improvement:
- Better organization of my time when starting very experimental tasks
- More consistency in doing courses
- When learning something, applying it with confidence

## Part two: Here and now
Description of first 6 months:
- I have successfully achieved what was expected of me.
Hi estic d'acord. Hi ha un punt de junioritat però molt d'espai per créixer.

What else is on your mind:
- Wedding preparation, mental health strained with lots of stress
- Lack of routine working at home

## Part three: Looking forward to the next 6 months
Role evolution:
- I would like to grow in the engineering side, becoming more familiar with Scala and with almost every task on the Data board.
It seems that business & roadmap goals will go very much in this direction. Would you agree?

- I would also like to participate in any machine learning project where an initial preparation of data and model selection is needed.
Not many chances for that, but is this the ML Engineering side of it, or the more R&D?

- Get stronger and faster on experimental tasks and be able to give my opinion on them.
Organised.

Business goals:
- Developing new projects in the direction of contextual advertising
- Learn more about the main projects in progress and be able to give my opinion about them.

Role evolution:
- Finish Scala course I started
- Start a course about ML or Deep Learning

Additional support:
- Udemy
Is udemy really enough for learning?

- Specific time during working hours
Tema organitzatiu

- Awareness of objectives when assigning tasks
Què podem fer per tal que quedin més clars els objectius?
