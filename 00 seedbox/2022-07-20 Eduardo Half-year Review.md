## General overview
 
## Part one: Looking back
Went well:
1. Starting to be productive quickly
2. Quality alternatives: NLP with state-of-the-art technology
3. Fit into the DS team's work dynamics

Agree con todo

Could have gone better:
1. More tasks together with the rest of the DS team in all phases beyond programming
    - Cómo? Trabajar más con Míriam para conocerla y ayudarla a formarse.
2. More functional and business model
    - Tiene que ver con haber entrado con algo tan especializado de entrada.
3. More knowledge about the information we collect and generate
    - El challenge aquí es cómo nos vendemos hacia el resto de la empresa.

Three key strengths
1. Curiosity
    - Inquietud
2. Technical soundness
3. R&D Experience

Key areas of improvement:
1. Functional and business knowledge
2. AI powered programmatic trading
3. HT domain data knowledge


## Part two: Here and now
No questions

Le agobia mucho el escenario mundial actual.

## Part three: Looking forward to the next 6 months

In 6 months I want to have a much deeper and broader perspective of the organization, business context and data and knowledge that goes into it.

Business goals
