## Agenda
The point is to clarify how to integrate with them so that they serve us frontend components to visualize.

- How do we serve them the data for the visualization
- How to we include their product within our frontend

## Notes
### What is a "GoodData Workspace"? (asked by Ines)
A workspace is a space which is individual per user and acts as a container for that user (our users are individual advertisers). The workspace guarantees credentials, security, data separation, etc.

There is a master workspace for creating templates and admin.

## Questions
- Es connecten a les nostres dades? O els hi fem push via REST API? --> Lo primer

## Actions
- Try out free versions and play around with the framework
- Timeline clarification on our behalf
- Pricing discussions (Ines vs Julie)
