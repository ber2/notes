This is a paper first, by [[Alibaba]], providing a [[ML]] method to learn how to estimate the [[Number of Distinct Values from a Sample]].

Second, there is a [[Python]] package, delivering a trained [[Neural Network]] which estimates the number of unique values given a sample and the total size of the population.
