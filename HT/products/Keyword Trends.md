__Keyword Trends__ is a [[HT]]] product that runs periodically.

It fetches occurrences of given keywords in [[third-party browsing data]] URLs, aggregates to daily counts of occurrences and then performs a [[Seasonal Decomposition#Additive Time Series Decomposition]] of the resulting time series.

The [[Indexing|indexed]] [[Trend]] is then returned and stored in [[Reporting]].
