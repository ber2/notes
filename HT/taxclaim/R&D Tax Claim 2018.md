The claim is structured around the Adserver Brain project.

After a short, one-paragraph introduction, there are sections as summarized below.

## Existing industry technology

Comparison of simple decision trees against [[Multi-Armed Bandit]] approaches.

Criteo SA have [[MAB]]s, and probably so do Facebook.

## Affectv's innovative approach

Details the proposal of adding the Brain infrastructure on top of the existing Adserver worflow.

### In 2017

![[adserver-brain-flow.png]]

- Completion of a global model builder (the same model is trained and then used on all campaigns).
- Updating infrastructure to support it.

### In 2018

Delivery of MVP and optimization.

- Delivery of model-free model using non-contextual [[Multi-Armed Bandit|MAB]].
- Moving from unified model to a model per campaign.

### 2019

> Engineering resources for this initiative will be limited as the focus will be on increasing adoption of the brain on our campaigns and reviewing its performance.
