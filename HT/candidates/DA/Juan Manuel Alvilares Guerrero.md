Q about external data sources

Poca experiencia treballant en anglès?

Worked in media agencies. Report to strategy team. Used to ad hoc investigation for big clients. Corte inglés, coca-cola.

Product test, brand test, etc

Current work methodology:

- Propose solutions by trying to deduce what the problem is for the client.
- Most of the time: specific questions
- En general, molt vague en aquest punt
- Example: fast moving consumer goods company. They need information about targeting. They prepare 6 or 7 different targeting profiles and a report on them. How they think, interact with the world, with media, how to reach them.
- Tools: AMC, worlwide PCI (??). EGM (estudio general de medios). Ad hoc research. Online interviews.
- They do not use SQL for these examples. They use SQL for other processes.
- "Data lake" mentioned.
- Use SPSS per inferència.
- I am not an engineer/programmer
