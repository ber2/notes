__Spark__ is a [[Parallel Computation]] system that allows for [[Distributed Computation]] on a cluster.

It runs on top of the [[JVM]] and provides several backend through which a program can distributed a computation and interact.

- [[Scala]], natively, through the fact that both run on the [[JVM]].
- [[Python]], through the [[PySpark]] library.
- [[SQL]], through [[SparkSQL]] and the ability to connect to a running cluster via [[JDBC]].
