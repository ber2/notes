Data Sampling is the procedure by which we can estimate global KPIs about a dataset from only looking at a small subset of the data.

- [[Spark Sampling]] is mostly concerned with obtaining samples fast in the setting of Spark Datasets and DataFrames.
- [[Inference and error bounding]] is concerned with the Bayesian inference that allows us to control estimation errors.
