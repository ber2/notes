__Principal Component Analysis__ is a method to obtain the __principal components__ of a collection of data points.

The principal components are a sequence of $p$ unit vectors where the $i$-th vector is the direction of the line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first $i-1$ vectors.

The directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are uncorrelated.
