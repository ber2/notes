# Progressive Predictive project

switch from CPA value to LTV (value of conversion along time)

Requisites for POC.

quote id is meaningless unless given pixel data

prediction of LTV

they create quartiles based on LTV
+ create lookalike audiences

bidding based on LTV

measure LTV per dollar
and amount of conversions

how much correlation there is between our LTV model and theirs --> this is described by the R^2 metric of the regression model.

report every week / twice a week, very high level

do we need a pixel? YES
