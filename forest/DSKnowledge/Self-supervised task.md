A __self-supervised__ learning task is a method for fabricating [[Labelled Data]] from [[Unlabelled Data]] in order to use it as [[Training Data]] for a [[Supervised Task]]. 

For example, in [[NLP]], one can break a sentence at a given place and extract a single word in order to obtain a labelled sample for a next-word prediction task.
