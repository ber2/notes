This is a very good book about Bayesian programming.

- Cameron Davidson-Pilon. _Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers_. [github](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers).

It contains an introduction to [[Bayesian]] statistics with a very practical purpose in mind. Great examples. Computations implemented in the [[PyMC3|PyMC]] (original notebooks & book) and [[PyMC3]] [[Python]] libraries (available contributed notebooks).
