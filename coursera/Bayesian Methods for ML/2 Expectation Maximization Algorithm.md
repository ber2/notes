## Week 2

The whole week revolves around the central topic of [[Latent Variable]] models and how to train them through [[Expectation Maximization]].

### Latent Variable models

The concept of [[Latent Variable]] is introduced and discussed. Next, it is put in practice by discussing a [[GMM]] for a [[Probabilistic Clustering]] problem.
